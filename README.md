# Housesales-MarketPrice
As a data scientist working at a real estate investment trust, the trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I'm tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I analysed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on.
